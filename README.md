[**Student Performance Analysis**](_pages/StudentPerformanceAnalysis.md)
This project involved a comprehensive statistical analysis of factors influencing student exam performance. Using a simulated dataset, I explored the impact of various lifestyle and demographic variables—including mental health, study habits, sleep, internet usage, and parental background—on academic outcomes.
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels, Seaborn), Statistical Hypothesis Testing, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization

[**Real Estate Property Management with Advanced Analytics**](_pages/RealEstateDB.md)
This project is a Real Estate Property Management System designed to streamline property tracking, maintenance requests, tenant payments, lease management, and more. It includes advanced SQL queries for ranking properties by open maintenance requests, calculating rent yields, tracking tenant payment history, and determining each owner’s total portfolio value. The system supports  efficient data retrieval and provides actionable insights for property managers, landlords, and investors to optimize decision-making.

[**Investment Portfolio Management with Python**](_pages/PortfolioTheory.md)
This project aims to optimize investment portfolios using Python by applying Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to analyze asset performance, minimize risk, and maximize returns. It identifies optimal portfolios through Monte Carlo simulations, calculates risk-return trade-offs, and visualizes key insights to guide informed investment decisions.
